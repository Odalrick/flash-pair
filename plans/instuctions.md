**Flash Pair: Quick Guide**

*Introduction:*
Welcome to "Flash Pair" - a rapid card-matching game that tests your reflexes and observation skills. Designed for face-to-face group play, this game promises an electrifying experience where you're never truly out until someone claims victory!

**How to Play:**
1. **Objective:** The aim is to be the first player to match a set number of cards. The total cards to match is determined by the selected game type in the lobby.

2. **Game Types:** Flash Pair offers various game types designed around both duration and difficulty. Choose one that fits the length and challenge you desire:
    - *Quick Dash:* Approx. 3 minutes.
    - *Standard Duel:* Approx. 5 minutes.
    - *Endurance Match:* Approx. 8 minutes.
    - *Ultimate Clash:* Approx. 12 minutes!

3. **Matching Cards:** During the game, two cards are displayed on screen. Each player's task is to spot a matching symbol on both cards. If you find a match, tap on the symbols. If you're the first to correctly identify and tap the matching symbols, you'll claim that card, and a new card will be presented.

4. **Victory:** The game continues until one player claims a number of cards based on the game type. Race against time and opponents to claim the top spot!

**Note:** As Flash Pair is designed for in-person group play, there's no need for chat functions or other communication tools. It's all about the game, your friends, and the thrill of the match!
